# Artist Statement

Mmm hot cross buns is an ad for - you guessed it - hot cross buns!  Or any kind of baked yummies really cos you can make your own out of the ingredients here.

To make a social media ad, I decided to build upon the cartoon-y style of drawing in p5 I started in the first assignment, and see if I could make it cute and engaging enough to hold the viewers' attention for the length of an ad.  

I remember how engaged my children were with several “Hey Duggee!” iPad aps, with really simple sequences like making a cake and personalising the icing (really just a fancy drawing tool).  

I also remember the success of the Victorian level rail crossing commercial, "Dumb Ways to Die", and figured a cute “critter” with a bit of humour could equal going viral if done well. The critter looks on eagerly at the buttons, your mouse cursor, and you, as if you needed any more encouragement to get cooking.

And since I could pick the product to sell, why not sell something that already sells itself?  Hot cross buns!  Mmmm.  Hungry?
